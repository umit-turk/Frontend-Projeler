        While the exact source of COVID-19 remains unclear, zoonotic diseases
        like COVID-19 — diseases that originated in animals — are a stark
        reminder of how people and nature are interconnected. Other serious
        outbreaks, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, were all zoonotic in
        origin. Animals aren’t to blame for these outbreaks. It’s human
        activities that encroach unsustainably into wild places and risky
        interactions with wildlife that create increased risk.

        Human-wildlife conflict is as much a development and humanitarian issue
        as it is a conservation concern. Despite being so strongly linked to the
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as the SDG 2 on zero hunger,
        human-wildlife conflict continues to be overlooked by policymakers. If
        the world has a chance of meeting the SDGs by the 2030 deadline,
        human-wildlife conflict must be explicitly included in SDG
        implementation plans, as well as at the heart of the Convention on
        Biodiversity’s new framework. A new report by WWF and the UN Environment
        Programme (UNEP) warns that human-wildlife conflict is the main threat
        to the long-term survival of some of the world’s most emblematic
        species. The report, A future for all - the need for human-wildlife
        coexistence, highlights that globally, conflict-related killing affects
        more than 75% of the world’s wild cat species, as well as many other
        terrestrial and marine carnivore species such as polar bears and
        Mediterranean monk seals, and large herbivores such as elephants.
        Wildlife faces numerous threats, among them, effects of climate change,
        loss of habitat from deforestation, illegal wildlife trade,
        infrastructure and now conflict with humans, factors that have led to a
        significant decline of wildlife species and to the possible extinction
        of species whose numbers were really low already. The report states that
        while it’s not possible to completely eradicate human-wildlife conflict,
        there are approaches that involve the full participation of local
        communities that can help reduce it and lead to coexistence between
        humans and wildlife. One success story is the Kavango Zambezi
        Transfrontier Conservation Area in Southern Africa where communities
        reported that most of their livestock losses through predation by lions
        occurred where free-ranging, unprotected cattle roamed in the evenings
        and at night. The installation of fixed and mobile lion-proof corrals
        for night-time protection in risk-prone areas led to a 95% reduction in
        livestock killings in 2016, and there were zero retaliatory killings of
        lions in 2016 (compared to 17 killed in 2012 and 2013), allowing
        previously threatened lion populations to recover. People who have never
        witnessed human-wildlife conflict can still play their part in tackling
        the problem by looking out for products certified by organizations like
        the Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network and the Rainforest Alliance.
        Reducing human-wildlife conflict can lead to opportunities and benefits
        not only for biodiversity and impacted communities, but for society,
        sustainable development, production, and the global economy at large.
